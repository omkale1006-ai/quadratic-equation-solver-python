# 📐 Quadratic Equation Solver – Python CLI Project

This Python project solves any quadratic equation of the form:

It calculates the roots (real or complex) based on the discriminant formula.

---

## 🔢 Formula Used

Discriminant:  
`D = b² - 4ac`

Roots:
- If **D > 0** → Two distinct real roots
- If **D = 0** → One real root (repeated)
- If **D < 0** → Two complex roots

---

## 📌 Features

- Accepts `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user  
- Handles all 3 cases: real & distinct, real & equal, complex roots  
- Uses the `math` module for calculations  
- Clean CLI output with clear messages  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- `math` module  
- CLI-based (Command Line Interface)  
- No external libraries required  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmKaleProjects/quadratic-equation-solver-python.git


## sample output
Enter coefficient a (a ≠ 0): 1
Enter coefficient b: -3
Enter coefficient c: 2
Two Real and Distinct Roots:
Root 1: 2.0
Root 2: 1.0
